# üåé Global Satellite Precipitation Estimation ‚Äì PUnet

Access to high-quality, high-resolution, near-real-time precipitation data is essential for hydrological and meteorological research and disaster mitigation. Traditional tools such as rain gauges and radar networks, though effective, have limitations, including sparse coverage in remote areas and high operational costs. Satellite data, with its global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolutions, mitigates limitations in coverage. Satellite precipitation products like Hydro Estimator (HE), Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) utilize both geosynchronous thermal infrared (IR) and passive microwave (PMW) data in their operation. PMW sensors offer detailed atmospheric profiles but suffer from higher latency, whereas IR sensors provide lower latency but only capture cloud-top information. Despite this constraint, IR data remains attractive for low-latency precipitation estimation.
Deep learning has significantly improved precipitation estimation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly UNet, have shown high efficiency in this domain. This study introduces PERSIANN-Unet (PUnet), a global satellite precipitation estimation using UNet, IR data, and monthly climatological precipitation to produce an operational product with half-hourly temporal and 0.04¬∞ √ó 0.04¬∞ spatial resolution. The new product is evaluated against HE, IMERG, and PDIR-Now for the independent period of 2022-2023. Results indicate that the new model outperforms current IR-based products (HE, PDIR-Now) on global and regional scales. Unlike models trained in small areas, which introduce edge noise when combined, this approach leverages data processing techniques like image resizing, guided filtering, and quantile mapping to enable global training, improving near-real-time estimation and climate data record reconstruction.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Background

Satellite precipitation products such as:

- **Hydro Estimator (HE)**
- **IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM)**
- **PERSIANN**

utilize both geostationary infrared (IR) and passive microwave (PMW) observations.  
- **PMW sensors** provide detailed atmospheric profiles but with higher latency.  
- **IR sensors** offer low latency, capturing cloud-top information, making them ideal for real-time estimation.

## üîç Introducing PERSIANN-UNet (PUnet)

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have enhanced precipitation estimation.  
**PERSIANN-UNet (PUnet)** is a global, deep learning-based satellite precipitation estimation framework that leverages:

- IR satellite data
- Monthly climatological precipitation inputs

### üìå Key Characteristics:
- **Spatial Resolution:** 0.04¬∞ √ó 0.04¬∞  
- **Temporal Resolution:** 30 minutes  
- **Training:** Global, using full-disk images (no tiling needed)  
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, guided filtering, quantile mapping

PUnet is evaluated against **HE**, **IMERG**, and **PDIR-Now** over the 2022‚Äì2023 test period and shows notable improvements over traditional IR-based methods.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **UNet Architecture:** Fully convolutional, tailored for spatial data
- **Full Global Processing:** Ingests entire image, minimizes edge artifacts
- **Monthly Training:** One model per calendar month for improved seasonal accuracy

### üõ†Ô∏è Post-Processing Steps

1. Temporarily downscale resolution to **0.234¬∞** for model efficiency  
2. Apply **bias correction** using IMERG Final  
3. Restore high resolution (0.04¬∞) using **guided filtering** with IR inputs

## üìä Model Evaluation

PUnet outperforms IR-based products such as **PDIR-Now** and **HE** in:

- **Correlation**
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

It aligns closely with **IMERG Final**, particularly in tropical and midlatitude regions.  
Although IMERG performs best over **CONUS**, PUnet remains competitive and reliable.

PUnet also effectively captures **extreme events**, maintaining low bias and RMSE.  
It aligns well with indices such as **R10mm**, **CDD**, and **CWD**, although it may slightly overestimate during very wet days.

## üîÆ Outlook and Applications

The PUnet framework is expected to become the next operational product in the **PERSIANN** family.  
Its exclusive use of globally available IR data positions it for reconstructing high-resolution **climate data records (CDRs)** dating back to **1983**.

PUnet outputs are visualized through the [**CHRS iRain system**](http://irain.eng.uci.edu/), making it useful for:

- Water resource management  
- Risk and disaster response  
- Climate monitoring
